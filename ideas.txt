useEffect: For side effects like fetching data, or setting up timers.

Conditional Rendering: Based on user input or the data you have.

API Integration: Fetching data from an API and displaying it.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step: What You Should Do Next (Today)
üîß 1. Refactor Your Todo App for Scalability
Start by turning your basic todo app into something that uses more advanced React features ‚Äî no new project needed yet.

üéØ Your Goal:
Upgrade your todo app to use:

useReducer for managing todo state (instead of useState)

useContext for global access (e.g., todos, user data)

Routing with react-router-dom (/todos, /completed, /settings)

A UI library (e.g., Tailwind CSS) for better styling

‚è±Ô∏è Time: 1‚Äì3 days
üõ†Ô∏è Here‚Äôs Your Immediate Plan:
üìå Day 1: Refactor State Management
Replace useState with useReducer for your todos

Create a TodoContext to share todos across components

Move all logic (add, delete, toggle, edit) into the reducer

Learn:

How to structure global state

Clean logic separation

üìå Day 2: Add Routing
Install and set up react-router-dom

Create these routes:

/todos ‚Äì show all

/completed ‚Äì show only completed

/settings ‚Äì placeholder

Add a navigation bar or tabs

Learn:

Routing, nested routes, layout components

üìå Day 3: Improve UI with Tailwind or Material UI
Add Tailwind CSS (or your preferred UI library)

Improve form styling, layout, and responsiveness

Optional: Add dark mode toggle (with useContext)

Learn:

Clean design + responsive UI

CSS utility classes or component libraries

‚úÖ Bonus (Optional This Week)
If you finish early, add:

Search/filter bar

Sort by date/priority

Due date picker (use react-datepicker)

‚úçÔ∏è To Track Progress
Make a checklist in your repo‚Äôs README:

markdown
Copy
Edit
## Todo App Roadmap
- [x] CRUD functionality
- [ ] useReducer for state management
- [ ] useContext for global state
- [ ] React Router for multi-page
- [ ] Tailwind styling
- [ ] Search/filter todos
- [ ] Add due date to each task
üîö After This Sprint
Once you‚Äôve finished these upgrades, you‚Äôll be ready for:

‚úÖ Authentication

‚úÖ React Query

‚úÖ Backend (Firebase or your own Express server)

‚úÖ Next.js
